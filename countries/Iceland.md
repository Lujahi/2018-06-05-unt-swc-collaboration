## interesting trivia
Iceland was settled by Vikings from Norway sometime in the 800s. This fact makes Iceland a fairly “young” country when it comes to 
settlement, and also contributes to its distinct cultural background. The Icelandic horses in the country today are unique in the fact 
that they are direct descendants from the horses the Vikings first brought over from mainland Europe.
